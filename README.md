# quickscripts
Quickly run your favourite applications and commands

## What?
I started this project from a need to be able to start all my most used programs, scripts, webpages, as quickly as possible but without having to memorize dozens of hotkeys.
The solution to this is to have _one_ hotkey which starts a GUI from which I can further select options for each of my programs.

## Requirements
Tested on both Windows and Linux
Requires python 3 and the following libraries:
```pip -m install yaml argparse```

## Usage

### List of things I'm never going to end up doing:
- Use https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard#keyboard.wait so that no external program is needed for hotkeys
- Write good code.
