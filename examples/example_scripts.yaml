##########################

# Here you can specify some additional configuration that will alter the behaviour of the program.
# Obviously, because of this you can't have a quickscript called "config"
config:
  # Specifies wether the window will have a border or not. Looks _a lot_ nicer without it, but can be finiky sometimes
  # Depending on your system, you will have to use either 1 or 2.
  # 0 - DEFAULT VALUE - Will have a border and behave as normal.
  # 1 - No border, will also snap to the corner for some reason. LINUX ONLY
  # 2 - No border. WINDOWS ONLY
  borderless: 1



# ALLOWED KEYS: Only the a-z keys have been tested, however more may work.
# BE CAREFUL WHEN PLAYING WITH THIS, ONLY USE KEYS WHICH HAVE BEEN TESTED.

# This is the most basic kind of use, where a key will always trigger the same command.
# You specify the `key` which will trigger the command, and the `cmd` itself.
# The same command will be executed across all machines this is configured in.
# (Most useful if you only have one machine, or a command is identical across mutliple)
Browser:
  key: b
  cmd: /your/path/to/anything/if/required/firefox.exe

# If however you have multiple machines with different OS's on them which run commands differently...
# ...you can specify the machines names as sub categories to the `cmd`, and each machine will run their...
# ...coresponding commands.
Facebook:
  key: f
  cmd:
    first_machine: C:\Program Files\facebook.exe
    second_machine: sh /home/user/games/facebook.sh

# You may also have some scripts which you only have on one machine. In that case, you can _only_ specify...
# ...that machine and the quickscript will not be visible on all other machines.
The Best Video Game:
  key: v
  cmd:
    first_machine: C:\Program Files\TheBestVideoGame.exe
