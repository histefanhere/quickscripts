##########################

# Here you can specify some additional configuration that will alter the behaviour of the program.
config:
  # auto - DEFAULT VALUE - switches between light and dark mode based on system
  # dark - Dark mode
  # light - Light mode
  theme: auto

  # Any positive integer, represents the number of rows of scripts (Defaults to 5 rows)
  rows: 5

  # Use this to replace any occurance of a string with another - look at Example 4 to see this in action
  replace:
    firefox_path: C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe

  # Or you can sub-categorize them by their device names:
  my_windows_computer:
    rows: 10


groups:

# "Webpages" here is called a group. Groups, well, group scripts togeather
# Use them to better organize all your different scripts.
- title: Webpages
  scripts:

  ###########
  # EXAMPLE 1
  ###########

  # This is the most basic kind of use, where a key will always trigger the same command.
  # You specify the `key` which will trigger the command, and the `command` itself.
  # The same command will be executed across all machines this is configured in.
  # (Most useful if you only have one machine, or a command is identical across mutliple)
  - name: Browser
    key: b
    command: /your/path/to/anything/if/required/firefox.exe

  ###########
  # EXAMPLE 2
  ###########

  # If however you have multiple machines with different OS's on them which run commands differently...
  # ...you can specify the machines names as sub categories to the `cmd`, and each machine will run their...
  # ...coresponding commands.
  - name: Facebook
    key: f
    command:
      my_windows_computer: C:\Program Files\facebook.exe
      my_linux_machine: sh /home/user/games/facebook.sh


# Here's another group that I've called "games" to group all my games togeather.
# Also, this group has a custom key! All the other will have numbers assigned to them by default, but this can be overridden
# by providing a key for the group.
- title: Games
  key: g
  scripts:

  ###########
  # EXAMPLE 3
  ###########

  # You may also have some scripts which you only have on one machine. In that case, you can also _only_ specify...
  # ...that machine and the quickscript will not be visible on all other machines.
  - name: The Best Video Game
    key: v
    command:
      my_windows_computer: C:\Program Files\TheBestVideoGame.exe


  # Notice here how we're able to use the key "f" despite using the f key previously for the Facebook script.
  # That's because it's in a different group!
  - name: Fire Boy % Water Girl
    key: f
    command:
      my_windows_computer: $firefox_path www.miniclip.com

  ###########
  # EXAMPLE 4
  ###########

  # This is an example of how you can use the `replace` config to shorten your configuration file and make it more readable!
  - name: some_website_1
    key: x
    command:
      # Here, $firefox_path will be replaced with the defined string we set in the beginning of the file. Note the dollar sign!
      my_windows_computer: $firefox_path www.some_website_1.com

  - name: some_website_2
    key: y
    command:
      # Same here. The dollar sign tells the code to replace it. Without it, the string would literally mean "firefox_path"
      my_windows_computer: $firefox_path www.some_website_2.com
