# ALLOWED KEYS: Only the a-z keys have been tested, however more may work.
# BE CAREFUL WHEN PLAYING WITH THIS, ONLY USE KEYS WHICH HAVE BEEN TESTED.

# This is the most basic kind of use, where a key will always trigger the same command.
# You specify the `key` which will trigger the command, and the `cmd` itself.
# The same command will be executed across all machines this is configured in.
# (Most useful if you only have one machine, or a command is identical across mutliple)
Browser:
  key: b
  cmd: /your/path/to/anything/if/required/firefox.exe

# If however you have multiple machines with different OS's on them which run commands differently...
# ...you can specify the machines names as sub categories to the `cmd`, and each machine will run their...
# ...coresponding commands.
Facebook:
  key: f
  cmd:
    first_machine: C:\Program Files\thebestgame.exe
    second_machine: sh /home/user/games/thebestgame.sh

# You may also have some scripts which you only have on one machine. In that case, you can _only_ specify...
# ...that machine and the quickscript will not be visible on all other machines.
The Best Video Game:
  key: v
  cmd:
    first_machine: C:\Program Files\TheBestVideoGame.exe
