# To use this script, copy this file to your home directory and rename it to ".xbindkeysrc" (with a dot).
# An example command is shown below:
# cp xbindkeysrc ~/.xbindkeysrc

# Now change the path below to point to the `run.sh` script in the `hotkeys` folder.

# Once you've done all this you should be able to trigger quickscripts via a hotkey, setup below is Alt + Q.
